## About

ClearMyDiscordHistory is an application that can clear your DM or server history on Discord as the name implies. It deletes all of the messages that you have sent. A preview of the app is shown below:

> [!NOTE]
> **After you click the start button, the app might stop responding. This is normal, it takes a long time to get the messages in order to delete them.**
>
> You can see the output in the console if you want to get feedback. If you don't want any feedback, use the noconsole version of the app.
>
> After starting the clearing process, you can type "cmdh" on any channel in Discord and it should respond that it is working.
>
> The application will close by itself after it is done.
