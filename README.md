## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning (Read me)

Neither ClearMyDiscordHistory nor any of the maintainers of the project are responsible if any damages occur by using the application. By running the application, you willingly take responsibility for any damages that may occur or happen.

ClearMyDiscordHistory is considered as a self-bot and self-bots are against Discord's ToS. Therefore, there is a risk of Discord taking actions against your account. It is highly unlikely that Discord will actually take any action against your account or you but I am still stating this so that you are aware of it.
