========================== WARNING ==========================

Neither ClearMyDiscordHistory nor any of the maintainers of the project are responsible if any damages occur by using the application. By running the application, you willingly take responsibility for any damages that may occur or happen.

ClearMyDiscordHistory is considered as a self-bot and self-bots are against Discord's ToS. Therefore, there is a risk of Discord taking actions against your account. It is highly unlikely that Discord will actually take any action against your account or you but I am still stating this so that you are aware of it.

=========================== USAGE ===========================

After starting the clearing process, you can type "cmdh" on any channel in Discord and it should respond that it is working.

The application will close by itself after it is done.

After testing, I found that if you close the app (noconsole version), it may still run in the background. So, make sure to open task manager and end the task. It is pretty easy to spot in the task manager because of the purple icon. I tried to fix this but I couldn't.

This is not a problem with the default app (console version). It only happens in the noconsole version. For console version, make sure to close both the app and the terminal that is opened.
